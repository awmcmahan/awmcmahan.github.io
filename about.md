My Name is Aaron Mcmahan. I am a Network Specialist at Panama-Buena Vista Union School District with a passion for open source projects. I am in charge of our districts 1:1 Ubuntu based laptops. I will be writing about the larger projects that are worth remembering and other neat things that interest me.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my son and lovely wife. If you are a recruiter, you may download my resume from this [link]({{ site.baseurl }}/content/images/awm_resume.pdf)
